This script parses various messaging history files and graphs messages over time.
So far it can parse: 
	Google Voice Takeout
	Skype History converted to CVS using http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/skype_log_view.html
	MSN messanger version I-have-no-idea xml history files.

Facebook Message/Chat archives are a work in progress.

Instructions for use will be added as the application matures.
